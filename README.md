The Walking Dead's Maggie to seek vengeance on Negan for Glenn's brutal death. 
Rick Grimes' beloved Walking Dead crew was obliterated by new sick villain Negan when he bashed in the skulls of his victims Abraham and Glenn, but no one was more devastated that pregnant Maggie, who was at risk of losing her baby after watching the bloody and merciless killing of her husband.

Lauren Cohan, who plays Maggie in the hit AMC show, has revealed how her character will recover and what's in store this season.

Lauren explained that Negan sees pregnant Maggie as “physically crippled” and has submitted to his demands.

“What Negan’s actions do to Maggie is light this crazy fuse. And we’ll see that burn pretty strong,”Lauren told Entertainment Weekly.

She revealed that while Maggie will want to seek revenge for her husband's death, she will have a struggle with coming to terms with this.

“Negan gives Maggie vengeance, and I don’t think that she’s a vengeful person, but It’s going to be a really interesting push and pull this season,” she explained.</p>

            <h2> Chapter 1</h2>
            <h1><b>The End Of It All</b></h1>
            <p><i>I swear I could see my reflection in one of their eyes, hundreds of eyes floating closer and closer to me in the darkness glowing like a dog's. I attempted to take a step back but couldn't move my feet, my mouth was dry and I felt a cold drip of sweat falls from my nose down my shirt. My hands were shaking violently, and I felt as though I was going to throw up. I wanted to scream, but I was too damn scared.

"Oh my god! Everybody! Get inside!" Screamed a voice behind me that snapped me out of my paralyzed state.

I whipped myself around and began to sprint toward the Walmart that was a couple hundred feet behind me. Panting heavily, I turned my head to glance over my shoulder to see hundreds of Walkers staggering through the parking lot, moans and grunts echoing through the large open space. The sight of their faces only made me increase speed, as I shot passed the sliding doors and ran inside. I fell to the floor and huddled myself into one of the check out aisles reaching behind me to pull the 9mm pistol from my jeans and cocked it, pushing my head down to not be seen over the aisle.

After what seemed like hours of silence, their was a bashing coming from the entrance and then the sound of glass cracking. My body tensed, and I slowly began to inch toward the back of the aisle glancing over the racks of assorted items to see if I could spot anybody else. I could only see Frank, a former state senator with a stick up his ass and the self appointed leader of the group taking refuge in the store. He had his back tight to the wall, with a shotgun in hand and looked as though he was giving orders to somebody with him but they were out of sight. I could hear pieces of glass smash into the floor, but couldn't see how far the Walkers were through. It didn't take me long to figure out however, as I saw one slam its whole body into the glass and begin to bash his head into the glass frantically immedietely cracking the thick glass.

"Aw no! Aw shit..." I spoke outloud as I raised my pistol toward the Walker, my hand quivering like crazy watching more and more Walkers pile up on the glass scratching, and pushing on the glass.

"Everybody! Retreat to the back of the store!" Yelled Frank as he began to back away quickly from the door with two other people I recognized as Julie and Matt, two people who took refuge in the store before I got here.

The group of three didn't get more than fifty feet away when the first Walker got through the glass unleashing a herd into the store. I hit the ground of the aisle, and pointed my gun toward the end of it. I was scared out of my wits, but I figured if I could get the drop on one of them they would horde to the aisle and I could get to the back of the store. As one of the Walkers came in my sights, I took a deep breath and stared at it for a minute. Its jaw was crooked and looked as if it had been hit by something previously, it had black hair that was in a mess on its head covered in blood and dirt. Its ominous green eyes slowly fall on me, as I pull the trigger of the gun.

I hear a shatter as a picture of the Employee of the Month comes smashing to the floor with a large hole in the center of it behind the Walker. I missed. I immedietely shot to my feet and began to sprint as fast as I could from the aisle. I could hear moans and growls behind me, hot on my heels. I could feel tears swelling up in my eyes as I ran, I didn't want to die, and I certainly didn't want to become like the infected. I ran into the electronics aisle and looked from left to right for any kind of spot to hide myself but there was nothing. I could see a dozen Walkers staggering down the main aisle toward the electronics, eyes locked on me.

"Nate! Get over here!" Yelled a voice to the left of me, and I swung around to see Frank poking his head out from the layway area, gesturing frantically for me to get over there.

I began to run over to him, when two Walkers appeared out of nowhere from one of the nearby aisles by Frank. I raised my hand and opened my mouth to warn him, but it was too late. One of the Walkers grabbed at his hand and sunk its teeth into his forearm causing him to let out a blood curdeling scream, until the other Walker bit onto his cheek ripping a large piece of flesh out before they both took him to the ground. I covered my mouth, as I felt vomit leak onto my hand. I closed my eyes before spitting onto the floor and beginning forward a look of both anger and fear. I lifted the 9mm up and pulled the trigger, hitting one of the Walkers in the shoulder.

"Shit!" I cursed as I cocked the gun once again and fired another shot, this time hitting the Walker square in the nose killing it instantly.

I cocked my gun again, and walked toward the Walker slowly as it turned its attention toward me and lunged at me. I pointed my gun upwards and waited for it to get as close as possible before pulling the trigger and spilling its brains onto the tiles. I peered over to Frank, who was laying on the tiles wide eyed, spilling blood onto the floor from his face and arm.

I took a moment to collect myself, breathing heavily from the excitement until I heard more moans behind me and I slammed the layway doors shut and began to pile up boxes to block the entrance, fighting against the Walker's best attempts to get through the door as I barricaded myself in. I took a few steps back from the barricaded door, leaning against the wall and slouching into a sitting position burying my face into my hands.

"Why... did this happen? Why... WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?! God damnit!" I screamed, as I felt tears streaming down my face, my whole body shaking. I didn't understand this new world, and I didn't know what I was supposed to do.

My thoughts and tears were interrupted by the familiar screech of a zombie, assuming it was just the dozen outside the barricaded door, I rubbed my eyes and looked up toward the barricade.

                "Shut up gee..." I stopped midsentence at the sight of a zombified Frank, inches from my face and this time... I could see my reflection in the eyes.</i>
